# project-1: City Explorer

## Description

Our application offers a seamless experience for discovering events and places based on city names inputted into the search box. Leveraging the power of two APIs, we fetch comprehensive information about events and places within the specified city. This dynamic integration allows users to explore a diverse array of activities and destinations tailored to their preferences and interests.

Furthermore, to enhance user convenience and facilitate revisits, we've incorporated a local storage feature. Every time a user inputs information, such as a city name, it is securely stored locally within their device. This ensures that their search history remains accessible for future reference without the need for repeated manual entry. With just a click of a button, users can effortlessly access their search history directly from the user interface. This functionality not only streamlines the navigation process but also promotes a personalised experience, enabling users to revisit previous searches and continue their exploration seamlessly.

Whether users are seeking exciting events or intriguing places to visit, our application empowers them with the tools to effortlessly discover and rediscover the world around them, all within a single, intuitive interface.
